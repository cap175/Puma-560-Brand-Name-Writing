# Puma-560-Brand-Name-Writing
this code takes an image of a brand name, finds the name's borders, all using python. then takes the coordinates of those borders and uses the robotics toolbox in MATLAB to make the puma 560 robot draw the brand name.
first, run the code in python, a bunch of csv files will be saved in the folder you saved the python code in. then the matlab code will import them and use them to guide the robot.
